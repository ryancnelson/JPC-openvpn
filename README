How to use this:

SUPER-FAST-SETUP:
  provision an Ubuntu 12.04 VM in the JPC, log in, run this:
  " curl https://raw.github.com/ryancnelson/JPC-openvpn/master/bootstrap| sh "

-----

Normal setup:

- provision a new Ubuntu 12.04 Linux VM in the Joyent Public Cloud
  and ssh into it.
  (this can be a 512MB VM... it's very low-overhead)

- apt-get update

- apt-get install -y git make

- git clone https://github.com/ryancnelson/JPC-openvpn.git 

- cd jpc-openvpn ; make

- Follow the on-screen instructions to copy the static.key file and the 
  client.conf file to your local machine.
  Adjust the file pathnames in client.conf as needed, and start openvpn with 
  that config file.
  EXAMPLE CLIENT START-UP:  openvpn --config client.conf
  (on my Mac, using http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/ , works ok )

Notes:  this is a quick setup, work-in-progress.  Please let me know how it works for you.  The single-user
nature of the static key setup means that you'll probably want to use this specific configuration just for
an ad-hoc vpn for yourself.  See the openswan documentation for more "enterprisey" deployment/configuration 
strategies.
