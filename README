How to use this:

- provision a new Ubuntu 12.04 Linux VM in the Joyent Public Cloud
  and ssh into it.
  (this can be a 512MB VM... it's very low-overhead)

- apt-get update

- apt-get install -y git make

- git clone https://ryancnelson@bitbucket.org/ryancnelson/jpc-openvpn.git 

- cd jpc-openvpn ; make

- Follow the on-screen instructions to copy the static.key file and the 
  client.conf file to your local machine.
  Adjust the file pathnames in client.conf as needed, and start openvpn with 
  that config file.
  EXAMPLE CLIENT START-UP:  openvpn --config client.conf
  (on my Mac, using http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/ , works ok )
